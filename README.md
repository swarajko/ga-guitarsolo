genetic algorithm for guitar solo generation (optimization)

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate guitar solos optimized for playability, musicality, and blues expression. The algorithm evolves a set of randomly generated guitar solos over multiple generations, refining them based on a fitness function that evaluates factors like note transitions, scale adherence, rhythmic coherence, and hand stretch feasibility.

How It Works

1. Initial Population: A set of random guitar solos is generated.

2. Fitness Evaluation: Each solo is scored based on playability, note diversity, and adherence to musical scales.

3. Selection & Crossover: The top-performing solos are selected to form the next generation.

4. Mutation: Random notes are altered to introduce variation and prevent stagnation.

5. Evolution: Over multiple generations, the algorithm converges towards a more playable and expressive solo.

6. Visualization: A real-time graph tracks the improvement in fitness scores across generations.
